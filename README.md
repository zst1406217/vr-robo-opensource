## Installation
We use two different environments for the Isaac Lab and the renderer. Please follow the instructions in each directory to finish the installation.
- For Isaac Lab environment, please refer to [vrrobo_isaaclab/README.md](vrrobo_isaaclab/README.md) for installation instructions.
- For the renderer environment, check out [vrrobo_renderer/README.md](vrrobo_renderer/README.md) to complete the setup.

## Usage
To run the demo, you need to first start the render server in the `vrrobo_renderer` directory:
```shell
conda activate vr-robo-renderer
python render_server.py
```
Then, start a new terminal in the `vrrobo_isaaclab` directory, you can run the following command to play the demo:
```shell
conda activate vr-robo-isaaclab
python scripts/rsl_rl/play_gs.py --task go2_gs_play
```
If you want to train the model, you can run:
```shell
conda activate vr-robo-isaaclab
python scripts/rsl_rl/train_gs.py --task go2_gs --headless
```
